Greeting! I'm AbyssalTheVoid, you can call me "Void" for short. I'm just a guy wandering my way into the world of games and dreaming one day to beceom the **King** of game creation...👑



## My hobbies
---Music🎤🎧---

---**Playing Game🎮🎧**---





These help me calm down from a stressful day and it is what I believe make life more **Enjoyable💟**.





## Level 1 
---Currently---
As of now, I'm **grinding🧩** experiences in the field of Python, C++, Blender, Roblox Studio and Unreal Engine.

-Working on small projects on Roblox studio platform.



## Favorite Game Inspirations💖

**Undertale**

  *Undertale* Sparks the light of interests in me:

- Singing

- Drawing

- **And most importantly** *The Story* of the game


## Dream Project💭 🗣🔥🔥

I want to create a game that have a *selling point* where the players can play the game however they want, to have control over the narrative of the game base on their *choices* and *consequences*.





## My Motto

"Do or do not. There is no try"
-Yoda


## Fun Facts

-I always make backup plans for myself because I'm a clumsy person.

-I got my name "Abyss or Abyssal" from an old Undertale Fan character named "Abyss Sans"

-I'm not sure if this a fun fact or not, but I really like drinking water.

-I have a high score of 1000 at Pectoralis Major Challenge (Ring Press) in Ring Fit Adventure.

-I twisted my right ankle 9 times straight, broke my right leg and have a glass stuck into my foot when I was a child, and this happened right after each one....

And that is why I'm applying to CMKL University AiCE Game Engineer B.Eng program, because I truly believe that they will be able to provide me the requirements needed for me to upgrade myself and move on the the next level.
